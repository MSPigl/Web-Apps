            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Captain <strong>Steven "Steve" Grant Rogers</strong> is a Super Soldier World War II veteran and was the world's first superhero. Born in Brooklyn, New York City, the young Steve Rogers suffered numerous health problems, at upon America's entry into the Second World War, was rejected from military service despite several attempts to enlist. Determined to serve, he ultimately volunteered for a top-secret Super-Soldier program, and the frail Steve Rogers was transformed into the powerful and heroic Captain America. His famous World War II exploits made him a living legend. Rogers attacked multiple HYDRA quarters with the Howling Commandos to the dismay of his greatest enemy, the Red Skull, while also developing a relationship with Agent Peggy Carter. Despite losing his closest friend, Bucky Barnes during a mission, Rogers carried on to help the Allies win the war, but crashed into the Arctic during his final mission. Awakening in the 21st century, Rogers learned that he had spent 67 years trapped in the glacial ice.<br><br>

                    Steven Rogers found himself alone in a modern world that he hardly recognized. When Nick Fury, Director of the international peacekeeping agency S.H.I.E.L.D., called upon Rogers to help save the world again, he once again suited up as Captain America, bringing his iconic shield to the Avengers during the Chitauri Invasion where he worked closely with Iron Man, the son of his friend Howard Stark. Fighting for the safety of innocent lives helped Rogers find his place in the new world as he joined S.H.I.E.L.D. to continue protecting the world from people who would have its freedom stripped away.<br><br>

                    After fighting along side the Avengers, Rogers became a dedicated S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and completed many operations with fellow agent and Avenger Black Widow. Along with Maria Hill and Falcon, they destroyed Project Insight. After the HYDRA Uprising, he went off on his own to search for his friend Bucky Barnes, with the help of Sam Wilson. In the midst of his quest, Rogers reassembled with the Avengers, working to bring down what was left of HYDRA, and made use of his leadership skills once again in the battle against the psychotic artificial intelligence, Ultron. Unlike most members of the original Avengers, Rogers remained as a member and the leader of the second incarnation of the team after the Ultron Offensive.<br><br>

                    In response to the massive loss of life caused by the Avengers, Captain America was ordered by Thaddeus Ross to sign the Sokovia Accords which would force the Avengers to have to operate under the rule of a governing body. Rogers and Tony Stark strongly disagreed on the issue and when the Winter Soldier became a target, Rogers directly disobeyed his orders to protect his friend. This action began the Avengers Civil War in which Rogers and a small team fought against Iron Man's team to protect or capture Barnes, eventually learning that Helmut Zemo was behind the devastation. When Stark learned that the Winter Soldier had killed his parents, Rogers was forced to hide Barnes in Wakanda with Black Panther and go on the run.

            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <h3>Life before the Avengers</h3>
                <p>
                    Steve Rogers was born on July 4, 1918, to Sarah and Joseph Rogers in Brooklyn, New York City. Before Rogers was born, his father Joseph was confirmed to be killed in action in World War I. At a young age he met James "Bucky" Barnes, who would eventually become his best friend.<br><br>

                    As a sickly adolescent, Rogers was frequently attacked by bullies on the streets. However, Rogers' resilience, despite his small stature, inspired a young James Barnes to come to his aid and fight off the bullies, and the two became good friends.In 1936, Rogers, now eighteen, discovered his mother had died of tuberculosis. She was later buried next to her husband. After the funeral, Rogers talked to Bucky Barnes, who offered to have Steve stay at his place and do errands to earn his keep, but Rogers declined, saying that he could get by on his own. Barnes told him he didn't have to and promised that he would be with him "'til the end of the line." Rogers held this statement close to heart for years. While both in art school, Steve and Bucky learned the the U.S. was entering World War 2. They both went to an enlistment center to join the fight, however, Steve was declared unfit to fight. Bucky was accepted and went on to enlist. Steve continually attempted to enlist, and was rejected every time. That is, until, Dr. Abraham Erskine witnessed one of Steve's attempts, and was impressed enough to enlist Steve as a candidate for Project Rebirth, a super-soldier program. Steve went to train with the other candidates, and his kind nature and strong will made him stand our from the rest, which resulted in Steve being chosen.

            <h3>Becoming an Avenger</h3>
                <p>
                    While painful, Project Rebirth worked, and increased Steve' physical stature and strength. However, Steve was still not allowed to fight overseas. Instead, he was given a position in the U.S.O. under the moniker "Captain America." He toured America acting as a propoganda piece to keep moral high at home. Eventually, Steve's act was moved to Europe, where he would perform in front of the soldier themselves. While in Italy, Steve overheard that his friend Bucky's unit had gone missing, and were assumed to be K.I.A. Unwilling to stand by and watch anymore, Steve infiltrated the base where the unit was being held, and freed them. This act of heroism gained Steve a great deal of respect from the troops, and he was given command of his own fighting unit: the Howling Commandos. He was also given a circular vibranium shield, emblazoned with a star. Steve performed various acts of heroism throughout is service during the war, but he was eventually encased in Arctic ice during a boat crash, which preserved his body in cryogenic stasis for the remainder of the 20th century. Decades later, Steve was thawed from the ice by S.H.I.E.L.D., and joined the Avengers Initiative.
