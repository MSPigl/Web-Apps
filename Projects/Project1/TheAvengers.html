            <h2>Formation</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Avengers Initiative</strong> was originally planned by S.H.I.E.L.D. It was meant to bring a team of extraordinary individuals together to defend Earth from threats that were beyond the capacity of regular fighting forces to handle. The "oficial" members were Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, with Thor allying himself with the group (they would later be joined by Vision and Scarlet Witch after the events of <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>). The Initiative was originally cancelled, but was reactivated due to the Chitauri invasion of New York City.

            <h2>Operations</h2>
                <p>
                    While active, the Avengers defended the Earth from two notable threats. The first of which was the Chitauri invasion of New York City, which would become known as "The Incident" to the world at large afterwards. The invasion was brought on by Loki, adopted son of Odin.<br> The second major threat that the Avengers faced was Ultron, an artificially intelligent lifeform unintentionally created by Tony Stark. Ultro wreaked havoc on the Avengers, and caused the destruction of a small region known as Sokovia.

            <h2>The Avengers Dissolve</h2>
                <p>
                    The chaos unleashed in Sokovia damaged the Avengers, and led to their breaking. Hulk went AWOL, and Thor returned to Asgard when he received visions of Ragnorak. The remaining Avengers were split by the Sokovia Accords, which would require the Avengers to be subject to a United Nations council, which would decide when and where to assign them.<br> The Accords were supported by members such as Vision, War Machine, and, most notably, Tony Stark. Captain America vehemently opposed the Accords. This schism led to the Avengers dissolving, with the rebellious half disappearing as wanted fugitives.
