            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark</strong> is an eccentric self-described genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist. He is also the armored superhero known as Iron Man. Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant to Nick Fury's peacekeeping intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki during the Battle of New York. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion. After the Battle on the Norco, the final event of Aldrich Killian's War, he destroyed all of his armors with the Clean Slate Protocol.<br><br>

                    However, when the Avengers were officially reassembled, Stark created new armors to fight the remnants of HYDRA. Once the threat had been ended, Stark, with the help of Bruce Banner, built Ultron as a peace-keeping A.I. to protect the world, but it defected and chose to destroy humanity instead. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated. After the war, however, Stark retired from the team, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created.<br><br>

                    The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to sign with Thaddeus Ross and create the Sokovia Accords. However, Stark's strong support of the accords lead to a disagreement with Captain America, who very much opposed the plans. When Rogers proceeded further to disobey orders by protecting Winter Soldier, Stark led the man-hunt for his old ally, igniting the Avengers Civil War.<br>

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <h3>Life before the Avengers</h3>
                <p>
                    Tony Stark was born on Friday, May 29, 1970 to Maria and Howard Stark, CEO of Stark Industries. Howard hired a butler named Edwin Jarvis before Tony was born. Jarvis became a good friend to Tony as he grew older. He watched over Tony throughout all of his childhood. Tony's early life was dominated by the absence of his father, yet that absence did little to hinder Tony's brilliance. When he was four years old, he made his first circuit board. When he was almost seven he built a V8 motorbike engine. At sixteen, he won the 4th Annual M.I.T. Robot Design Award. When Tony was seventeen he graduated MIT at the top of his class. When he was 21 Tony's parents fell victim to a fatal car crash, leaving Stark Industries to Tony in the process. Under Tony's control, Stark Industries became one of the world's premiere weapons developers, among other technological marvels.

            <h3>Becoming an Avenger</h3>
                <p>
                    While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new Stark Industries weapon, Tony's convoy was attacked by insurgents representing a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings. During the attack, a bomb went off in Tony's proximity, which rendered him unconscious. Tony awoke in captivity to find himself attached to an electromagnet. The blast had embedded shrapnel in his chest, and the electromagnet was the only thing preventing the blast shards from damaging his heart. Stark, along with fellow captive Ho Yinsen, forumlated an escape plan, and constructed a primitive armored suit to help them achieve their freedom. During their escape, Yinsen was wounded. He urged Tony to leave him behind, and to not waste his life once he escaped. Tony fought his way through the camp, and escaped. He made contact with the U.S. Air Force, and was returned to the United States. Upon returning home, Tony went through a process of trial and error to rebuild his suit, making adjustments and improvements with every new version. Tony went through various trials and tribulations, including winning his company back from Obadiah Stane, who had taken control in Tony's absence. These trials led to Tony becoming the armored hero known as Iron Man. Tony eventually encountered Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who convinced him to join the Avengers Initiative.
