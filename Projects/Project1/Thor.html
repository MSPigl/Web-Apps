            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Thor Odinson</strong> is the prince of Asgard and a former member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible behavior threatened his homeland, he was stripped of his power and banished by his father Odin to Earth. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, found love in Jane Foster, and helped to save his new friends from a destructive threat sent by his jealous adoptive brother Loki. In the process, Thor redeemed himself in the eyes of his father and was granted access to his power once more.<br><br>

                    After being welcomed back to Asgard as a hero, Thor visited Earth to retrieve Loki after Loki began his attempt to take over the world. He joined the Avengers and fought with them against the Chitauri during the Battle of New York. After he returned to Asgard he helped the Asgardian armies restore peace to the Nine Realms. He fought against the Dark Elves during the Second Dark Elf Conflict, killing their leader, Malekith, and ending the threat. During these events, he was reunited with Jane Foster after she became host to the Aether and became a target of the Dark Elves. Eventually, the Aether was removed from her body and the Dark Elves were defeated. Thor renounced his claim to the throne and left Asgard for Earth so he could stay with Foster.<br><br>

                    During his stay, Thor helped the Avengers once again, this time fighting against HYDRA. Following HYDRA's defeat, the team had to stop Ultron, a rogue invention created by Tony Stark. Once Ultron was defeated, Thor went back to Asgard to investigate the visions he saw when being manipulated by Scarlet Witch, which showed him the Infinity Stones. In his investigations, Thor realized that Loki still lived and had usurped Odin's throne. To aid in both pursuing his brother and finding his father, Thor sought help from Doctor Strange and the Masters of the Mystic Arts.

            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <h3>Life before the Avengers</h3>
                <p>
                    Thor had an idyllic childhood, brought up in Asgard as the treasured son of Odin and his wife Frigga. His best friend and playmate was his adopted brother Loki, and though they were rivals for their father's throne, they still remained close companions. Loki was taught magic by their mother, while Thor was taught how to be a warrior by their father. Brought up in the warrior culture of the Asgardians, Thor valued strength, courage, and loyalty above all else. He desired to be exactly like his father, the war hero, and received the powerful hammer, Mjølnir. Thor often remarked on the monsters he would slay and the wars he would win once he was king.<br><br>
                    
                    Thor proved himself a great warrior, often leading his band of warriors, which included Lady Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three on adventures. However, he was also known to be reckless when Loki jokingly reminded him that he would be dead had he not used a smoke veil to allow them to escape during one battle. Thor also defeated Imir, a rogue Asgardian who threatened to take control of Asgard and kidnapped several Dwarves. While Imir managed to get the upper hand on Thor, he was eventually defeated when Thor electrocuted him with Mjølnir.<br><br>
                    
                    Eventually, Thor's arrogance led to his banishment from Asgard, and exile to Earth.

            <h3>Becoming an Avenger</h3>
                <p>
                    While on Earth, Thor drew the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D., who captured him and questioned him. Even after Thor proved himself worthy to be king of Asgard and left Earth, he remembered the connections he made, and returned when Earth was threatened by the Chitauri invasion. It was then that he fought side by side with heroes like Iron Man and Captain America, and became an Avenger.
