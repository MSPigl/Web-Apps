            <h1>The Tragedy<h1>
            <p>
                Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? <br>
                I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend.<br>
                Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…<br>
                He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br><br>
                
                He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.<br> Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.<br>
                Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
